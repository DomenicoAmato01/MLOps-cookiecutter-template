# Cookiecutter Template for MLOps Projects

This is a `cookiecutter` template designed to bootstrap production-ready **machine learning** projects. It provides a standardized, MLOps-oriented structure using modern tools, helping you move from a research notebook to a robust, reproducible, and automated pipeline.

### Core Features

* **Reproducibility by Design:** Version everything from code (`Git`), to data (`DVC`), to experiments (`MLflow`).
* **Modular Structure:** Clean separation of concerns for data processing, model definition, and training logic.
* **Configuration-Driven:** Manage all your parameters (hyperparameters, paths, etc.) from a central `params.yaml` file.
* **Automation-Ready:** Includes a basic CI pipeline with GitHub Actions for testing and linting.
* **Scalable:** The foundation is built to scale from local development to cloud deployment.

### Tech Stack

* PyTorch or Tensorflow
* DVC (Data Version Control)
* MLflow
* Docker
* GitHub Actions
* Conda

## Getting Started

To use this template, you'll need to install `cookiecutter`:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

Then, run the following command to generate your project:
```bash
cookiecutter gh:YOUR-USERNAME/cookiecutter-medical-segmentation
```
